# GPlotFun

The GPlotFun package is a collection of gretl scripts and functions for advanced plotting methods. Gretl's built-in plotting facility makes heavy use of the well-known open-source graphing utility Gnuplot (URL: [http://www.gnuplot.info/||http://www.gnuplot.info/]). Gretl already offers a plotting facility, as described in Ch. 8 in the manual. However, some types of plots are either hard to realize using the current state or not supported at all. This package is an attempt to bridge the gap between Gretl's current state of employing gnuplot and gnuplot's huge capability to draw very different and advanced plots.

The GPlotFun package makes heavily use of gretl's support of bundles which offer a highly flexible way of programming. This initial package version is a suggestion, and the author is looking forward to collaborate with interested people to continue its development.

The GPlotFun package comprises the following features:

• Time-series plots with vertical and horizontal lines, with vertical and horizontal shaded areas, and impulse as well as point plots.

• Scatter plots supporting classes of points and lines.

• Stacked barplots combined with line plots.

• Heatmaps

• Many parameters can be controlled for obtaining high-quality graphs.

In the following sections, we will inform the interested user or potential supporter where to download the package. Next, we will introduce some examples and show how to control the output before a more detailed overview about the various options will be shown.
